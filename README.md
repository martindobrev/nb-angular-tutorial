# Welcome to my angular tutorial repo

This repository contains an angular project that accompanies my tutorial on Angular. More information about it can be found [here](https://martindobrev.github.io/nb-angular-tutorial/).

The project will be expanded as the course progresses. Git tags will be used to mark key tutorial CHECKPOINTS so that you can easily start anywhere.
Major tag version numbers will represent the lection number and minor version numbers will mark the CHECKPOINTS of each lecture.

For example tag v1.2 is the third checkpoint of the first lecture. The tag message describes the last project changes.

## Initial README generated by Angular CLI

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 7.2.1.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
